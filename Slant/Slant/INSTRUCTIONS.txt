How to Run the Slant Game
=========================

Prerequisites:
- Java JDK installed (Java 8 or higher)
- Terminal/Command Prompt available

Steps:

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and navigate to the project root directory:
   cd c:/Users/Saketh/OneDrive/Desktop/Slant

2. Compile the Java source files:
   javac -d out -sourcepath src/main/java src/main/java/slant/Main.java

3. Run the application:
   java -cp out slant.Main

4. You should see a window titled "Slant Game" appear.

Note:
- The `out` directory will be created automatically by the compiler to store class files.
- If you add more files, you might need to include them in the compilation command or simply re-run the command above as it points to the Main class and uses sourcepath.
